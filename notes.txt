- Geometric algebra library for 3D stuff.
- Vec3, Rotor3, Mat4 classes.
- Vec3 and Rotor3 mostly written already in the ember experiment, will pull in.
- Writing up Mat4 implementation.
  - First thing to add is Rotor3 -> Mat4 conversion.
  - Multicursor algebraic expansion.
  - Using aa, ab, ac, etc. format for components.
  - Works very well with multicursor manipulation.
  - Can copy the letters a, b, c, d into four cursors and paste them in batches where they're needed.
- Added Vec3 and Rotor3.
- Added testing framework, added some tests.
  - Most bugs in forgetting to return this.
  - One bug in multiply, not sure how abdd was used at some point.
