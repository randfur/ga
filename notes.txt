- Added scale to Mat4.
- Added turn around to Rotor3.
  - Needs to take two right angle vectors to know the plane to turn around in.
  - Just does a double right angle turn.

- Added more matrix tests.
  - Combining translations and rotations appears to work as expected using left multiplication.
- Added exporting to array buffers for Mat4.
  - Exporting as column major.
  - Need to find documentation for this.
  - Supposedly this is how WebGL accepts matrices.
  - Having thoroughly tested the theory.
- Added x, y, z convenience helpers to Temp.
  - Not too sure if it's that useful but should be eventually.
- Fixed Rotor3 not specifying which side inplace multiplication happens on.
- Fixed Vec3 not having default values.

- Geometric algebra library for 3D stuff.
- Vec3, Rotor3, Mat4 classes.
- Vec3 and Rotor3 mostly written already in the ember experiment, will pull in.
- Writing up Mat4 implementation.
  - First thing to add is Rotor3 -> Mat4 conversion.
  - Multicursor algebraic expansion.
  - Using aa, ab, ac, etc. format for components.
  - Works very well with multicursor manipulation.
  - Can copy the letters a, b, c, d into four cursors and paste them in batches where they're needed.
- Added Vec3 and Rotor3.
- Added testing framework, added some tests.
  - Most bugs in forgetting to return this.
  - One bug in multiply, not sure how abdd was used at some point.
